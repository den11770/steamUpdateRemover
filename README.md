# Steam Update Removal Utility

This is a utility that allows you to play "Update Required" games without updating in offline mode.

Start by downloading this script bundled with the necessary Lua binaries from the releases tab.  
If you only have one library in the standard location, you can leave the script as is.  
If you have a nonstandard location or more than one library, edit the script, there is additional info at the bottom.  
When you're done, quit Steam.  
Now, either doubleclick *start.bat* **or** drag *script.lua* over *lua53.exe* and let go.  
Observe as Steam magically forgets about all pending updates.
